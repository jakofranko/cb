\<some creative name\> - A Character Builder
============================================

This is a tool I'm building in Node.js to help with RPG character creation. I'm hoping to eventually have modules for many games, but right now I'm building out a builder for the [HERO System](http://www.herogames.com)(5th edition)

## General Information
<pre>npm start</pre>
Will run the app at localhost:3000
Uses [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) for the database, and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) as the driver. Don't forget to run <pre>mongod</pre> before starting!
